            <h1>Module 9: Building a Robot</h1>

            <p>You don't need tutorials. This is merely a checklist module of what to build to make your robot good. You're already a capable builder if you've gone through all the modules until now. Now is the time to build two things: A robot and a universal gear frame for future tools. </p>

            <h2>To Make a Good Robot, You Need...</h2>

            <ul class="normalulelaborate">
                <li>
                    <strong>Low center of gravity</strong>: Your robot must have most of the materials it's made up of down rather than up. This ties closely with weight distribution towards the back.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Weight-distribution towards the back</strong>: The back has to be the area with more of the weight because the front carries tools, and if you want your robot to perform well (turn properly), then back-weight is a great idea.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Lots of surface area where tools could be placed</strong>: Surface area on the front of a robot is excellent for these reasons:
                    <ul class="normalulelaborate">
                        <li>
                            Gives technicians lots of room to adjust and place tools.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            More gap between gears (to add gear ratios or to have 2 small motors).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ability to go around the entire FLL field without deviating from the set path</strong>: You'd likely need a very stable robot with a border around.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Example Robot: CH33S3C4K3-01 (by Professor Cheese)</h2>
            <p>Professor Cheese created this CAD as a representation of all 4 criteria. It doesn't mean it's the best robot for FLL. It's meant to teach.</p>

            </div>

            <p>2 interesting features on this robot include a border that supports the large motors and wheels, and the surface for tools at the front (which includes a compatible area for knob gears). Those knobs can easily be switched out for normal gears, and they're used here to remind you that knob gears exist. Using knob gears also provides tons of grip between the motor and the driver gear.</p>
