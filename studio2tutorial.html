<h1>What is Studio 2.0?</h1>

<p>Studio is a <strong>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</strong> tool specifically made to help builders <strong>plan</strong> a certain creation, like a MOC, before ordering parts and building it in real life. 
    For FLL, it helps students share their ideas without having to build something in real life first. Just imagine if you had to take apart your entire tool just to make a simple 
    change! That would be strenuous, and doesn't yield <strong>results</strong> unless you are very experienced. In short, Studio is a designing tool optimized for efficiency.
</p>

<h2>Download Studio 2.0</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, download Studio for your device using this link below to the direct Bricklink site.</p>
<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page" target="_blank" class="linkbutton">Download Studio 2.0</a>
<p>Simply follow Bricklink's download button, and you should have Studio downloading. Once downloaded, click on the "Downloads" button at the top right of your browser and click on the most recent download to open the package. 
    Unfortunately, Studio doesn't work on certain devices, and a desktop is highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>Creating Your First CAD File</h2>

<p>After opening Studio and setting everything up for it (with the help of Bricklink) you should see a menu to the left of your window that looks like this:</p>

<p>Click on "Create New". For now, don't worry about creating an account for Studio, as we'll save anything that comes after this in a folder on Google Drive.</p>

<h2>Your Studio Workspace</h2>

<p>You will see a screen with a platform to place bricks on, various menus, and some tools at the top left of the window.</p>
<img src="module2studioworkspace.png" class="rounded-image">
<p>This is going to be your Studio <strong>Workspace</strong>, where you'll be able to build your idea and work on the <strong>planning</strong> section of the Engineering Design Process. 
    Thankfully, there are some <strong>tools</strong> within the workspace that will help you do just that.
